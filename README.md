# File Upload

A simple project where I learned how to upload files, make checks before uploading them, and using Cloudinary to store files on the cloud

#### Project Setup

- Create .env file, then add correct variables of: MONGO_URI, CLOUDINARY_NAME, CLOUDINARY_API_KEY, CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET
- Run
  ```bash
  npm install && npm run
  ```
